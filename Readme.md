The Nobel Prize is a prestigious international award that has been given annually since 1901. It recognizes outstanding achievements in various fields such as chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The recipient of the Nobel Prize not only receives honor and recognition but also a substantial prize money and a gold medal featuring Alfred Nobel, the founder of the prize.

For this project, we have access to a dataset provided by the Nobel Foundation, which contains information about all the prize winners from 1901 to 2023. The dataset is available in the `nobel.csv` file located in the data folder.

In this project, we will analyze the Nobel Prize winner data and answer several questions related to the data. We encourage you to explore further questions that interest you as well.

Here are the questions we will answer:

1. What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?

   - Store your answers as string variables `top_gender` and `top_country`.

2. Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?

   - Store this as an integer called `max_decade_usa`.

3. Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?

   - Store this as a dictionary called `max_female_dict`, where the decade is the key and the category is the value. There should only be one key-value pair.

4. Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?

   - Save your string answers as `first_woman_name` and `first_woman_category`.

5. Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?
   - Store the full names in a list named `repeat_list`.
